Introduction:

Hello, my name is Tisha and I am a freshman in the College of Engineering. I am a member of the Michigan Research and Discovery Scholars (MRADS) living-learning community.

I am planning to major in Computer science, with a concentration in AL and Machine Learning, and a minor in Statistics.

A fun fact about me is that I can move my ears! It seems that only 10-15% of the world's population posses this trait.
As you can see, I love numbers :)
